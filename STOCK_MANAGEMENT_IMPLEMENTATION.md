# Stock Management Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added comprehensive stock management functionality to the admin panel's product management menu, allowing administrators to easily update product inventory levels.

## Features Added

### 1. Backend API Endpoints
- **New Route**: `PATCH /api/products/:id/stock`
  - Operations: `add`, `subtract`, `set`
  - Updates `availableQuantity` in product inventory
  - Automatically updates `isInStock` status
  - Returns old and new quantity for tracking

### 2. Frontend Stock Management UI
- **Stock Update Modal**: Full-featured modal for custom stock updates
- **Quick Action Buttons**: One-click +10/-10 stock adjustments
- **Visual Stock Indicators**: Color-coded stock status (In Stock, Low Stock, Out of Stock)
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate UI refresh after stock changes

### 3. Enhanced Admin Panel Features
- **Toast Notifications**: User-friendly success/error messages
- **Low Stock Alerts**: Dashboard alerts for products with low inventory
- **Improved Product Table**: Shows current stock with management controls
- **Better UX**: Loading states and proper error handling

## Technical Implementation

### API Layer (`server/routes/products.js`)
```javascript
// New stock update endpoint
router.patch('/:id/stock', authMiddleware, adminMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
  // Handles add, subtract, set operations
  // Updates inventory.availableQuantity and status
});
```

### Frontend API Client (`src/api/`)
```javascript
// Added PATCH method to client.js
async patch(endpoint, data = {}) { ... }

// Added stock management functions to products.js
updateStock: async (id, quantity, operation) => { ... }
```

### UI Components (`src/component/admin/AdminPanel.jsx`)
- Stock Management Modal with operation selection
- Quick update buttons for common operations
- Toast notification system
- Low stock dashboard alerts
- Enhanced product table with stock controls

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators:

1. **Access Stock Management**:
   - Navigate to Admin Panel â†’ Products tab
   - Each product shows current stock levels

2. **Quick Updates**:

   - Changes apply immediately with confirmation

3. **Custom Updates**:
   - Click "Custom" or the package icon for detailed options
   - Choose operation: Add, Subtract, or Set stock
   - Enter desired quantity and confirm

4. **Monitor Low Stock**:
   - Dashboard shows low stock alerts
   - Products with â‰¤10 units are flagged as "Low Stock"
   - Zero stock items marked as "Out of Stock"

## Stock Status Indicators
- ðŸŸ¢ **In Stock**: >10 units available
- ðŸŸ¡ **Low Stock**: 1-10 units available  
- ðŸ”´ **Out of Stock**: 0 units available

## Error Handling

## Database Updates
The implementation uses the existing Product model structure with `inventory.availableQuantity` field, ensuring compatibility with existing data while adding new stock management capabilities.

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding bulk stock update functionality
2. Implement stock movement history tracking
3. Add automated low stock email notifications
4. Create stock level reporting and analytics

The stock management feature is now fully functional and integrated into the admin panel, providing a complete solution for inventory management.
