# Project Debug Report - AgriBasket

## Summary
Comprehensive debugging and fixes applied to the FramToHome/AgriBusket project.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ESLint Configuration Issues
**Problem**: ESLint configuration was not properly handling different file types
- ❌ Server files were being linted with browser globals
- ❌ Node.js files causing 'require is not defined' errors

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Updated `eslint.config.js` to ignore server directory for frontend linting
- ✅ Added separate config for Node.js config files
- ✅ Properly configured globals for different environments

### 2. Code Quality Issues
**Problems**: Multiple unused variables and code style issues
- ❌ Unused imports (motion, hoverGreen, selectedProduct, etc.)
- ❌ Unused variables in components
- ❌ Unnecessary escape characters in regex patterns
- ❌ Case statement scope issues in CartContext

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Removed unused variables and imports
- ✅ Fixed regex pattern escaping
- ✅ Added proper block scope to switch case statements
- ✅ Cleaned up component code

### 3. Database Model Issues
**Problems**: 
- ❌ AuthUser model had invalid enum value for role field
- ❌ Duplicate email index causing warnings
- ❌ Undefined variable references in routes

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Added 'customer' to role enum in AuthUser model
- ✅ Removed duplicate email index (kept unique constraint)
- ✅ Fixed `AuthAuthUser` to `AuthUser` references
- ✅ Fixed `updatedAuthUser` to `updatedUser` references

### 4. Security Vulnerabilities
**Problems**: 9 npm vulnerabilities in frontend dependencies
- ❌ High severity: DOM Clobbering, ReDoS attacks
- ❌ Moderate severity: RegExp vulnerabilities, esbuild issues

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Ran `npm audit fix` to resolve most issues
- ✅ Remaining 3 moderate vulnerabilities require breaking changes (noted for future)
- ✅ Server dependencies: 0 vulnerabilities (clean)

### 5. Database Connection and Testing
**Verifications**:
- ✅ MongoDB connection successful
- ✅ All required collections exist
- ✅ Database indexes properly created
- ✅ Model validations working correctly
- ✅ Existing data: 6 products, 5 users, 14 orders

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Components
1. **Backend Server**: Running on port 18562
   - MongoDB connection: ✅ Connected
   - Email service: ✅ Configured
   - API endpoints: ✅ Responding
   - Authentication: ✅ Working
   - CORS: ✅ Properly configured

2. **Frontend Application**: Running on port 18561
   - Vite dev server: ✅ Running
   - React components: ✅ Loading
   - API integration: ✅ Configured
   - Routing: ✅ Working

3. **Database**: 
   - Connection: ✅ Stable
   - Models: ✅ Validated
   - Indexes: ✅ Optimized
   - Data integrity: ✅ Maintained

### ⚠️ Minor Issues Remaining
1. 3 moderate security vulnerabilities in frontend (require breaking changes)
2. Some React Hook dependency warnings (non-critical)
3. Fast refresh warnings for context files (cosmetic)

### 🧪 Testing Results
- ✅ Database connection test: PASSED
- ✅ Model validation tests: PASSED
- ✅ API health check: PASSED
- ✅ Server startup: PASSED
- ✅ Frontend startup: PASSED
- ✅ ESLint checks: PASSED (no errors)

## Configuration Files Status
- ✅ `.env` files: Properly configured
- ✅ `package.json`: Dependencies updated
- ✅ Database config: Working
- ✅ API endpoints: Configured
- ✅ CORS settings: Proper ports

## Performance Notes
- Database has proper indexes for efficient queries
- Email service configured and verified
- Rate limiting enabled for API protection
- Security middleware (helmet) active

## Recommendations for Production
1. Upgrade Vite to latest version to resolve remaining security issues
2. Review and update React Hook dependencies warnings
3. Consider implementing additional API testing
4. Set up proper error monitoring
5. Configure SSL/HTTPS for production deployment
